The goal of the project is to compare different types of Machine Learning Models on Given Lung Cancer Dataset.

The Models used are:
Logistic Regression : Accuracy = 0.95
SVM : Accuracy = 0.94444
Decision Tree Classifier : Accuracy = 0.93
Random Forest Classifier : Accuracy = 0.94
XGBooost Classifier : Accuracy = 0.95
